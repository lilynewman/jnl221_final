          In recent years, the number of females receiving diplomas has continued to increase. This trend is not new as more women have been encouraged to pursue their careers in the past few decades. In contrast, the increase of males receiving diplomas has been slowing. 
        </p>
        <p>
          According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/11/08/whats-behind-the-growing-gap-between-men-and-women-in-college-completion/" target="_blank">Pew Research</a>, education correlates with lifetime earnings and wealth accumulation, making this data significant. The think tank has also found that 62% of adults over the age of 25 do not have a four-year college degree.

          In all three types of institutions, significantly more women are receiving degrees than men. For degrees of four years or more, there is a 34.4% difference. For degrees below associate, males only make up one-third of the graduates throughout the years. While these degrees serve different purposes, they are finding the same gap. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/TrendGenerator/app/build-table/4/210?rid=225&cid=5" target="_blank">National Center for Education Statistics</a> found that women make up 59% of the total graduates from 2011-12 to 2020-21. While both female and male graduates have continued to increase in recent years, they are not doing so at the same rate. Since 2015-16, the percent change of males has decreased substantially, from 2% to .71%.

          Cathy Bertini, a Guidance Counselor and College Advisor at Herbert H. Lehman High School in the Bronx, NY has found “in the last 4 to 5 years there’s been a trend where the boys are opting to trade school rather than college.” This could be due to an increased demand for plumbers, electricians, and similar professions as well as their unionization and good pay.

          An increase in labor force participation by married women has been a big factor in this change. As gender roles widened, so did familial roles. This gave women with husbands or children a chance to do both: work and have a family. The increase of women attending and graduating college is a result of the increasing acceptance of women in the workplace as well as more women in supervisory positions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Pew Research has found that men usually give the reason that they just didn’t want to finish college or other personal reasons when asked why they didn’t complete their degree while women are more likely to say they could not afford it. Bertini points out that many boys wonder “do I really want to “waste” 4 years if I can start working right away? Trade schools only require 18 or however many months.”

          While female graduates have continued to increase over the past decade, degrees below associates were declining until a major change of 13.7% occurred in 2020-21. For degrees of four or more years, it has been steadily increasing. As the type of institution with the most students, change is less drastic.

          Today there are so many more career options for women that they wouldn’t have even dreamt of 50 years ago. Cathy Bertini points out that there may be pressure for women to attend college because they feel lucky to have the opportunity which men do not have, leading to the increase of women attending and graduating college.
